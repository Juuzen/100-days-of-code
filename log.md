# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** I completed the first part of the Ray Wenderlich tutorial on Core Graphics (you can find the link below)! I made this app that takes track of our water consume in terms of drunk glasses (on a maximum basis). It is really simple, no UI, no UX, just buttons and lines, but it works! I even made some new features, for example modifying the value of the maximum glasses you have to drink to complete your daily task (and this feature opened the way for some logical and graphical bugs that were really funny to see). I'm continuing the tutorial with the second part of the tutorial and, if there will be some progresses, I'll write here once more!

### Day 1: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **MVP pattern** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** This time, I focused on making my code cleaner and understandable, applying the MVP pattern. With more practice, it will become easier to understand. I worked with [backsofangels](https://github.com/backsofangels) this time!

### Day 0: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** Initially, it is really difficult to understand what is going on, because there are a lot of concepts you have to handle during the same time. But I managed to create a custom UIButton class!
