# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: FMarch 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** Initially, it is really difficult to understand what is going on, because there are a lot of concepts you have to handle during the same time. But I managed to create a custom UIButton class!
