# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **MVP pattern** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** This time, I focused on making my code cleaner and understandable, applying the MVP pattern. With more practice, it will become easier to understand. I worked with [backsofangels](https://github.com/backsofangels) this time!

### Day 0: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** Initially, it is really difficult to understand what is going on, because there are a lot of concepts you have to handle during the same time. But I managed to create a custom UIButton class!
