# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 12: June 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Starting working on audio mixing!

**Thoughts:** I got **AVAudioEngine** to work properly, so it was pretty obvious starting on working on mixing different audios!

### Day 11: June 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working with **Bundle**, **Tableviews**, **AVFoundation**

**Thoughts:** I set up the tableview with all the functionality rows have to have, right now I'm finding a way to get all files in a single directory.

### Day 10: June 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working with **Bundle**, **Tableviews**

**Thoughts:** I correctly managed to get a single audio from inside my app, but this wasn't enough. The main goal, here, is to learn how to get all the audio files inside my app and put them correctly in a Tableview, with some buttons for the audio players.

* [Bundle documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle?changes=_2)

### Day 9: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Working with **AVFoundation**

**Thoughts:** I managed to get a single audio file to play, pause and stop inside my app. For the future (aka tomorrow I hope), I'd like to be able to choose between 4 different audio files.

### Day 8: June 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** New project! Working with **Core Audio**

**Thoughts:** For me it's quite difficult to stay at pace with the Challenge, mainly because my work in the Apple Developer Academy takes a lot of time... but I'm here! Right now, I started a new project, entirely on my own: I want to build a simple soundboard app where you can play different tracks at once. I'm currently seeing some tutorials and documentation for Core Audio and Split View Controller.

### Day 7: May 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Creating storyboards, object positioning

**Thoughts:** Nothing really important to say here, just starting from the scratch to learn in a deep way how things are done in the iOS ecosystem.

### Day 6 (?): May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Starting again with the project!

**Thoughts:** Yep, I know, it's a lot of time that passed without doing anything... it's my fault! After Easter, I got really busy with the Apple Developer Academy and so I didn't fulfilled my daily task with this project... I'm sorry for that and I'm ready to start again! Right now, I just started the "iOS 11 & Swift 4 App Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy (that you can find [here](https://www.udemy.com/ios-11-app-development-bootcamp/)), so let's see what will happen in the future!

### Day 5: March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning about **GameplayKit** and **SpriteKit**!

**Thoughts:** I started learning more about **GameplayKit** right now. What I wanted to learn is how to randomically generate a maze, and then use **GameplayKit** to implement some Strategists for solving it. I used [Pathfinder: Gameplay Pathfinding Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Pathfinder_GameplayKit/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016461-Intro-DontLinkElementID_2) as a starting point. I translated it from *Swift 3* to *Swift 4*, fixed all the warnings that raised in the process, and now I can start working on my playground! I realised that the sample code made by Apple uses **SpriteKit**, so it will be really interesting learning about it as well!

### Day 4: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learning about **Timer** and **GameplayKit**!

**Thoughts:** I completely changed what I wanted to do, and I started again from scratch. After a while, thinking about what I wanted to do for attending the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*, I wanted to use **UIKit**, **Timer** and **GameplayKit**, so these will be really long days!

After a lot of hours, I managed to let the timer work on the Playground! You can see it here: http://bit.ly/timerinplayground

### Day 3: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning about **Playground Books** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** It seems quite linear for now, but it will become more and more interesting once I can try my Playground Book by myself!

### Day 2: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** I completed the first part of the Ray Wenderlich tutorial on Core Graphics (you can find the link below)! I made this app that takes track of our water consume in terms of drunk glasses (on a maximum basis). It is really simple, no UI, no UX, just buttons and lines, but it works! I even made some new features, for example modifying the value of the maximum glasses you have to drink to complete your daily task (and this feature opened the way for some logical and graphical bugs that were really funny to see). I'm continuing the tutorial with the second part of the tutorial and, if there will be some progresses, I'll write here once more!

### Day 1: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **MVP pattern** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** This time, I focused on making my code cleaner and understandable, applying the MVP pattern. With more practice, it will become easier to understand. I worked with [backsofangels](https://github.com/backsofangels) this time!

### Day 0: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with **Core Graphics** for the *WWDC 2018 Scholarship Program*.

**Thoughts:** Initially, it is really difficult to understand what is going on, because there are a lot of concepts you have to handle during the same time. But I managed to create a custom UIButton class!
